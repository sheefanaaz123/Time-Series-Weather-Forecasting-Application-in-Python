# Time-Series-Weather-Forecasting-Application-in-Python

In this tutorial, we will be learning how to use the pandas library in order to create time series weather forecasts. We will be using the popular data preprocessing libraries numpy and pandas to clean and prepare our data, followed with creating models that use weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) website to predict future weather conditions. We will then analyze our results in order to determine whether or not our model is accurately predicting weather events. Our final project will be to write an application that calculates daily forecasts using data from the first two months of the project period.

Here in this project we have: 


-Preprocessed our data from our dataset using the Pandas library. 
-Trained a time series forecasting model to predict temperature using the model. 
-Forecasted the temperature into the future.
-Performed some exploratory data analysis on our data, trained our model, and finally made the predictions.
